Problem Identified:
===============

TMM web application is accessing another url.
The url is public/

Example:

Main URL:
 https://www.taslimamarriagemedia.com/page/about-us

Access another public URL:
https://www.taslimamarriagemedia.com/public/page/about-us

Problem Solved:
=============

Actually it is another way to access the webapp
I've fixed it by updating your Document Root on cPanel in our server.
public/ URL is gone!

Example:

Main URL:
http://tmm.beautycrazy.xyz/page/about-us

Url able to access public url:
http://tmm.beautycrazy.xyz/public/page/about-us

We are success & we was able to solve this problem in our server.
I want to do this same process in TMM web server.

How we solved this:
===============

Just we added "public sub directory in Document Root."

This is the actual solution for this problem. We was able to do this because of our domain is addon domain & subdomain.

In main domain we was unable to to add  "public sub directory in Document Root."
